Welcome
=======
Hi,
I am Ali Mirzaei, born on December 1990 in Iran, Birjand. I have been graduated from the Electrical Engineering department of [Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT)](http://www.aut.ac.ir/aut/fa/) in 2013. In the second year of undergraduate I was awarded to study computer science as a second major. The Computer Science major sparked my interests in  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Therefore I persued my interests in MSc. working on Machine Learning Algorithms under supervision of [Dr. Sheikhzadeh](http://www.aut.ac.ir/official/main.asp?uid=hsheikh) and [Dr. Mohsenzadeh](https://sites.google.com/site/dryaldamohsenzadeh/). As I was 2nd rank in EE department in Communication branch I was awarded to study MSc. at AUT without entrance exam. 

Armed with the thorough knowledge of artificial intelligence, I have been gaining practical hands on experience in line with my graduate studies through working at [Faradid Co.](www.faraadid.com) (since 2015). Being a part of this company afforded me the opportunity to hone my technical skills in tackling real-world image processing and machine learning problems. 

Iâ€™m now pursuing a PhD degree at Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT) under the supervision of Dr. Sheikhzadeh and Dr. Pourahmadi. I am interested in generative models as Generative Adverserial Networks (GAN) and Autoencoders.
