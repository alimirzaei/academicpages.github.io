Kernel based approaches are one of the most well-known methods in regression and classification tasks. Type of kernel function and also its parameters have a considerable effect on the classifier performance. Usually kernel parameters are obtained by cross-validation or validation dataset. In this paper we propose a classification learning approach which learn the parameter (kernel width) of Gaussian kernel function during learning stage. The proposed method is an extension of RVM which is a Bayesian counter-part of well- ...
